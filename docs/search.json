    "text": "In order to hone my skills at dataviz creation in matplotlib and ggplot2, I’ve been replicating interesting charts I see in the news. I’ve been noticing more horizontal stacked bar charts in articles on news sites. I’m guessing the horizontal construction plays better with screens and, if the chart is presenting minimal information, like the answer to a survey question, it breaks up or grounds the columnar format nicely. Here’s an example from a recent publication from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nUnfortunately, matplotlib doesn’t seem play nicely with legend labeling. I spent several hours trying to tweak different forms of this chart using different tutorials. My first attempt was the following:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ncategory_names = ['A lot', 'Some',\n                  'Not too much', 'Not at all']\ncategory_colors = [ '#001e36','#004a87', '#00b588', '#1a7563']\nresults = {\n    'Total Democratic women voters': [49, 33, 13, 5],\n    '18-29': [27, 47, 22, 4],\n    '30-49': [41, 36, 14, 9],\n    '50-64': [56, 26, 12, 6],\n    '65+': [66, 27, 7, 0]\n\n}\n\n\ndef survey(results, category_names):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    results : dict\n        A mapping from question labels to a list of answers per category.\n        It is assumed all lists contain the same number of entries and that\n        it matches the length of *category_names*.\n    category_names : list of str\n        The category labels.\n    \"\"\"\n    labels = list(results.keys())\n\n    data = np.array(list(results.values()))\n    data_cum = data.cumsum(axis=1)\n#     category_colors = plt.colormaps['RdYlGn'](\n#         np.linspace(0.15, 0.85, data.shape[1]))\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9.2, 5))\n    ax.invert_yaxis()\n    ax.xaxis.set_visible(False)\n    ax.set_xlim(0, np.sum(data, axis=1).max())\n\n    for i, (colname, color) in enumerate(zip(category_names, category_colors)):\n        widths = data[:, i]\n        starts = data_cum[:, i] - widths\n        rects = ax.barh(labels, widths, left=starts, height=0.5,\n                        label=colname, color=color)\n        \n\n        text_color = 'white'\n        ax.bar_label(rects, label_type='center', fmt = \"%.0f%%\", padding=-8, weight='bold', color=text_color)\n    ax.legend(ncols=len(category_names), bbox_to_anchor=(-.29, 1), loc='lower left', fontsize='small')\n    ax.text(x=-.09, y=1, s=\"How much, if at all, do you trust Vice President Kamala Harris to speak about abortion policy?\", transform=fig.transFigure, ha='left', fontsize=13, alpha=.8)\n    \n\n\n\nsurvey(results, category_names)\nplt.show()\nWhich yielded this.\n\n\n\nFirst attempt\n\n\nNext, I tried\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# dataframe\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A lot': [49,27,41,56,66],\n                   'Some': [33,47,36,26,27],\n                   'Not too much': [13,22,14,12,7],\n                   'Not at all': [5,9,8,6,0]},\n                   index=['Total Democratic Women Voters', '18-29', '30-49', '50-64', '65+'])\n\n# get the totals for each row\ntotals = df.sum(axis=1)\n\n# calculate the percent for each row\npercent = df.div(totals, axis=0).mul(100).round(2)\n\n# create the plot\nax = percent.plot(kind='barh', stacked=True, figsize=(9, 5), color=['#001e36','#004a87', '#00b588', '#1a7563'], xticks=[])\n# move the legend\nax.legend(loc='upper left', ncol=4, frameon=False, bbox_to_anchor=(-.5, 1.1))\n\n# remove ticks\nax.tick_params(left=False, bottom=True)\n# remove all spines\nax.spines[['top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right']].set_visible(False)\n\n# iterate through each container\nfor c in ax.containers:\n    \n    # custom label calculates percent and add an empty string so 0 value bars don't have a number\n    labels = [f'{w:0.0f}%' if (w := v.get_width()) &gt; 0 else '' for v in c]\n    \n    # add annotations\n    ax.bar_label(c, labels=labels, weight='bold', label_type='center', padding=1, color='w')\nThis improved the labels on the bar, but didn’t help with the y-axis labels or legend mat size.\n\n\n\nSecond attempt\n\n\nIn my final matplotlib attempt, I tried to tweak the rc_params.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ncategory_names = ['A lot', 'Some','Not too much', 'Not at all']\nresults = {'65+': [66, 27, 7, 0],\n           '50-64': [56, 26, 12, 6],\n           '30-49': [41, 36, 14, 9],\n           '18-29': [27, 47, 22, 4],\n           'White': [50,35,10,5],\n           'Hispanic': [42,31,20,7],\n           'Black': [51,25,18,6],\n           'Total Democratic Women Voters': [49, 33, 13, 5]}\n\n# setup dataframe using the dict provided in the OP\ndf = pd.DataFrame(results, index=category_names)\n# transpose df from the OP so Party is the in the columns and Ward is the index\ndft = df.T\n# plot\nax = df.T.plot.barh(stacked=True, figsize=(10, 6), color=['#001e36','#004a87', '#00b588', '#1a7563'])\n\nax.legend(loc=(-.365,1.03), ncol=4, frameon=False, markerscale=12)\nSMALL_SIZE = 8\nMEDIUM_SIZE = 10\nBIGGER_SIZE = 12\n\nplt.rc('font', size=BIGGER_SIZE)          # controls default text sizes\nplt.rc('axes', titlesize=SMALL_SIZE)     # fontsize of the axes title\nplt.rc('axes', labelsize=MEDIUM_SIZE)    # fontsize of the x and y labels\nplt.rc('xtick', labelsize=SMALL_SIZE)    # fontsize of the tick labels\nplt.rc('ytick', labelsize=MEDIUM_SIZE)    # fontsize of the tick labels\nplt.rc('legend', fontsize=BIGGER_SIZE)    # legend fontsize\nplt.rc('figure', titlesize=BIGGER_SIZE)  # fontsize of the figure title\nplt.rcParams['xtick.top'] = plt.rcParams['xtick.labeltop'] = False\nax.set_yticklabels(results.keys(), ha = 'left')              # Set horizontal alignment to left\nax.yaxis.set_tick_params(pad=200,            # Pad tick labels so they don't go over y-axis\n                         labelsize=11,       # Set label size\n                         bottom=False, top=False)       # Set no ticks on bottom/left\n\n# annotations:\nfor c in ax.containers:\n    \n    # format the number of decimal places and replace 0 with an empty string\n    labels = [f'{w:.0f}%' if (w := v.get_width()) &gt; 0 else '' for v in c ]\n    \n    ax.bar_label(c, labels=labels,label_type='center', color='w', weight='bold')\nWhich put the y-axis labels where I wanted, but I still couldn’t figure out the mat changes.\n\n\n\nThird attempt\n\n\n\nI finally gave up and tried using Flourish, a dataviz product. I wasn’t familiar with it, but going down the rabbit hole looking for solutions, I found it recommended by an Al-Jazeera datalab journalist. Here’s the product.\n\n\n\nUsing Flourish\n\n\n\nLater, I’ll see if I can learn more fixing those legend values.\n\n\n\nOriginal\nFirst attempt\nSecond attempt\nThird attempt\nUsing Flourish"
