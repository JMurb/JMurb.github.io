My capstone project involves automating the essential components of a forestry data start-up's GIS pipeline. The pipeline breaks down into three major stages. The first stage of the pipeline involves formatting client-provided data during the intake process. Clients usually provide a shapefile of forest stands. The shapefile usually includes unique identifiers the client uses to track age and development of timber assests. It may be provided in a state plane coordinate system. It must be reprojected to the World Geodetic System EPSG:4326 and be formatted with several startup specific fields to faciliate data collection and processing. In most cases, the next step is running a plot sampling script to randomly select sample plots in the stand according to the customers sampling methodology. Occasionally, clients provide an additional pointfile of centerpoints for plots they wish to be use for sampling. The basic workflow is to copy the customer data and reproject the copies to EPSG:4326, create a geopackage layer, add field values individually via a field calculator in QGIS, map client-named fields to their internal field schema by hand and use the field calculator to populate the values, run the sampling algorithm, create new fields in the newly-formed plots layer, bundle all of the new layers into a single geopackage and upload them to a designated folder on AWS.

The initial days of Sprint 1 were spent finishing up the first draft of the Stem Map script to include sharing and group creation. The bulk of the work was spent on the development of the Field Map script.
